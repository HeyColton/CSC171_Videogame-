# CSC171_Videogame-
My program has one JFrame and two Panels in it. The first one is ControlPanel on which there are lives that can be taken when the ball falls on the ground, score that increases, count-down time( one arc and one string) and one button to activate two-player model. The second one draws one ball and platforms players control.

Control Key: First Player: Left Arrow to go left. Right Arrow to go right.
Second: “a” to go left. “d” to go right.


At the first level, the remaining time will be set to 60. When you reach the second level, the remaining time will be reset. In tens of seconds, there will appear five secret boxes whose locations are random.
Two will definitely increase you score. Three have randomness.
